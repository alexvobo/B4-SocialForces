goal force - 
	Given the desired velocity, current velocity, direction from the agent's current position to the goal, and a constant T, we achieve a steering behavior
	by re-calculating the direction in which we need to move instead of the agents following a beeline.
proximity force -
	The proximity force is responsible for exponentially reducing the force when agents are far away from eachother 
	and exponentially increasing the force the closer agents get to eachother. We couple this with repulsion force to push nearby agents away from each other.
repulsion force - 
	The repulsion force is an "explosive" force, where k*g(Rij-Dij) will become a really large number when the agents are overlapping and 0 otherwise.
	The goal of the repulsion force is to push agents away when they begin to stack. The more they overlap the bigger the force.
	Both the proximity force and repulsion force are applied in the same direction.
sliding friction force -
	The goal of sliding friction force is to push an agent i away from an agent j tangentially to avoid a collision. 
	The magnitude of this force depends on the direction that the velocities are applied, so agents traveling in opposite direction will experience a greater force.
	Similar to repulsion force, the farther the agents are away from each other the smaller the force, and it will increase as agents get closer to each other.
